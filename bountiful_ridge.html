        <p>
            The effort-to-reward ratio for Bountiful Ridge is pretty good, because it keeps a lot of people away,
            even some of the more advanced B/C skiers.  It's just not worth it to them, and that's fine with me.
            They can have the Cottonwoods, and I'll enjoy my solitude
            on B-bridge.  That withstanding, B-ridge has gotten a bit more crowded in recent years, but
            more often than not, I find the place all to myself when I go there.

                It was quite surreal this day on B-ridge.  With the valley blanketted with fog, it was easy to pretend you
                were a world away from civilation.  Ah, so nice!  Isn't that at least one reason we go to the mountains --
                to escape the world?  This photo was taken just north of Black's Peak apron.

        <p>
            Beyond B-ridge is the Burro Mine where you can find longer pitches and steeper terrain.  It's often
            frequented by the Wasatch Powder Bird Guides.  I'm very cautious of skiing that terrain, though; I
            don't do it unless the ava-rose is solid green.  And even then I learned a scary lesson.  A few weeks of green ava-rose can
            lead to dry-loose sluff avalanches.  One took me off my feet and partially burried me up there.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite run in the Burro Mine has an entrace between two massive trees, spaced in such a way
            that it's almost as if someone designed it as a doorway to an amazing ski slope.  I dubbed the line "Gold Strike" in the KML file.  I can't be
            sure of its exact location on the map, but what I've labeled there is approximately correct.  You'll know it when you see it.

                I think this is one of the many shots you can take in the Mark's Ghost area.  There are so many great variations here.
                Admittedly, even though the pitches are probably shorter than most would like, they're perfect for me.
            </figcaption>

        <p>
            Anyhow, the best way to get to B-ridge is through North Canyon.  (Muller Park Canyon seems closer,
            but as of this writing, there is no easy trail into the area from this side.)  There are some named shortcuts
            to Rudy's Flat, but I've been swarn to secrecy here, so I'm going to limit my treatment of
            the tour to a description starting from Rudy's Flat.  And besides, the short-cuts are actually pretty obvious when you look at a topo
            of the area, and if you try going up there on a good ski day, you're more than likely to find
            someone's skin-track up one of the shortcuts anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many different ways to gain the ridge from Rudy's Flat.  After climbing East a ways, sometimes
            I go to the South to gain the ridge proper.  Going North into the so-called Rectangle Bowl area has the advantage
            that if this is what you're going to ski, then once Rectangle Peak is sumitted, you've already got your
            up-track laid down for subsequent laps.

                I'm pretty sure this is a line into Crescent Bowl.  One of the longest lines possible is right of this, I believe.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            However you gain the ridge, you'll find so many great options.  I like to skip a lot of great terrain (e.g., Crescent Bowl) and
            go a bit further toward Black's Peak, because not many will do this.  They'll take the low-hanging fruit
            and leave the rest.  But with just a bit more effort you'll reach my favorite part of the Ridge: Mark's Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
            On days when seemingly all the snow surrounding B-ridge is bad, the Mark's Ghost area has a habit of holding
            great snow nevertheless.  This is certainly due to its being at just the right
            aspect, and relatively sheltered from the sun and wind.  There have been days when this
            area was the <i>only</i> good skiing on the entire ridge, and had I turned back before reaching it, I would have
            thought all the snow as bad.  Admittedly, I ski this part of the ridge almost exclusively.  I just really
            like this part of the ridge.
            I can remember days here where my skis were just popping out of the snow with each turn.  It was so much fun!

                This was taken just before the sun went down, or perhaps after it had.  I recall skiing out by moonlight, because
                I either forgot my headlamp or the batteries were dead.  Anyhow, this is just north of Black's Peak apron on B-ridge.

            One of the longest runs starts at a high point and goes into Crescent Bowl, but you must be weary of rocks.
            Speaking of rocks, you really have to watch out for them all over the ridge, especially the solar aspects.
            I've gotten multiple core-shots on B-ridge!
        </p>
        <p>
            I've had my run-ins with wet-slides and dry-loose sluffs, but no slab avalanches.  That's why I'm not dead yet!
            Slab avalanches are the least managable and the most dangerous.  When the trap is sprung, it propogates
            in all directions, even up the slope.  There's no escape!  You're going for a ride.

                Skiing Gold Strike will land you here at the Burro Mine, if I recall correctly.  The rock formation
                is called the Citadel, I believe.  Watch out for snowmobilers!  They like to venture here and track
                everything out in minutes after you've worked so hard to get there.

            One day on B-ridge things didn't seem stable.  I was following a skin track up above Rudy's Flat.  I then decided
            to leave the track heading North.  The moment I stepped out of the skin track I heard it!  Herrumph!  It was a collapse
            in the snow.  Now, why in the world I didn't take this is a sign to get the heck out of there, I don't know, because
            I knew better than that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite my better judgement, I insisted on summetting Rectangle Peak.  Long-story-short, I got to the top,
            but it was an awful experience.  Every few steps I thought the whole slope was going to pull right out from under me.
            I could tell that things just weren't stable at all.
            The further up I went, the more committed I seemed to be.  Skiing back down was sure to be more stress placed on
            the slope than me continuing up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once at the top, I had to figure out how in the heck I was going to get down.  One observation that could be made
            is that there was a lot of cross-loading on the slopes below me.  So it stood to reason that if I stuck to the
            windward side, the snow would be stable.  Sure enough, it was, and I hit a few rocks where it was wind-scowered, but
            obviously that's better than triggering a slab avalanche.
        </p>
        <figure class="float-left pic">

            <figcaption>
                These are my tracks down one of the so called "big drop" runs into the Burro Mine.  My tracks here
                look stupid, I must admit, but as I recall, it was a fantastic run with fantastic snow.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Now here's another funny thing about all this.  I skinned back to the same place where I heard the first collapse.
            After getting back onto that original track, this time I stepped off of it to the South.  Herrumph!  It was another
            collapse in the snow pack(!), this time on the South side of the track!
        </p>
        <p>
            One lesson to be gleaned here is: break trail whenever you can.  Get yourself off the skin track.  Try to get a
            feel for what the snow is doing.  And for heaven's sake, if you hear a collapse, then it's time to go!  That is,
            as they say, bulls-eye information.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recall one of my avalanche instructors, Tyson Bradley, saying, "if you don't want to know what's going on in the snow, then by
            all means, don't dig.  Ignorance is bliss!"  Having taken this advice to heart, I'll occassionally dig in the snow.
            Doing so has turned me back more than once.
        </p>
        <p>
            When no signs seem to be presenting themselves while breaking trail, and I have reason to believe there
            may be some lurking PWLs, I will dig a pit where it seems to make sense for what I want to ski, then
            try to do an ECT.  They get easier with practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note, however, that a pit that shows a stable snowpack can only raise your confidence level a very, very small amount, if at all,
            because it's only telling you what's going on in the snowpack right then and there.  Any kind of observed collapse in a pit test,
            on the other hand, tells you everything you need to know: it's time to go home or find safer terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I'll say that at the time of this writing, the Bountiful City Trails Committee has plans to make a trail that cuts right
            across all the fantastic ski terrain on B-ridge.  On a good snow year, it's possible that the trail would be so burried in snow
            that it wouldn't negatively impact the skiing, but I don't think that would always be the case.  It would suck for a once perfectly
            level and beautiful slope to now have a man-made divet going through it.  And there could be other
            negative impacts on the area too with them cutting trees down.  I am just not a fan of the idea at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you also have to take into account where this is coming from!  This is me we're talking about here.  <i>I</i> wouldn't build the
            trail if it was up to <i>me,</i> and that's really saying something, because I absolutely love trails, and the mountains, and mountain
            trails, and hiking, and on and on.  At the same time, I understand that not every trail should be built.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think if people could really feel and experience the beauty of this place (B-ridge), then they, like me,
            wouldn't want to take the chance of changing it either.
            If something is already perfect, why try to fix it?  You're only going to make it worse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, I've digressed a bit here.  Back to the tour.  How about the exit?  Whatever you do, don't try to exit down Mueller Park
            Canyon.  It's a horrible bushwhack, and even if you do get to the trail, the trail isn't steep enough to glide down.
            It's best to go back the way you came.  I usually use Rectangle Peak as my exit run.
            In good conditions you can ski from there all the way back to Rudy's, and from Rudy's to your car.  Watch out for dog crap
            on the North Canyon Road.  And by the way, there's no shame in using snowplow technique the whole way down that road.
            I'm amazed at anyone who does otherwise on skis.  What's more amazing are all the people who, despite it being the heaviest winter
            on record, think they can push their SUV or truck or whatever up that road as far as possible.  I laugh every time I see
            an abandoned vehicle up there.
