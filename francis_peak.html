            In the days when my Dad and I buzzed around the mountains on four-wheelers and dirt-bikes there was always a certain wonder that
            struck me whenever we stopped somewhere with a view of Francis Peak to the north along the spine of the Wasatch.  I didn't mind the bulbs at the time.  Those just added
            to the wonder.  These days, however, I wish I knew what the mountain looked like before its top was chopped off.  Supposedly, my late step-grandfather
            had a hand in clearing the top of the mountain to make way for the "salt and pepper shakers", as we like to call them.  In any case,
            this peak is still a worth-while destination for backcountry skiers.

            The best approach for skiing Francis Peak is along the Wolverine Trail.  Start by parking in the cul-de-sac nearest the mouth of Shephard Canyon.
            Once your skis are mounted on your pack, start booting up the paved path toward the below-ground water tank.  Passing that you get on
            a dirt trail that takes you to a section of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail headed North.  Not long on the BST, you'll see the turn-off to
            the Wolverine Trail, and it is brutally steep!  Going up really isn't so bad.  It's coming down at the end of the day with skis on your back
            that will really bust your knees.  Alternatively, you can exit down Bair Canyon instead, then take the BST going South back to the truck.
            Which way you choose may have more to do with careful avalanche-minded terrain choices than anything else.

            Mile 1.35 along the route shown in the KML file is the first potential skin-up point; depending, of course, on what time of year you go.
            As I recall, I had to shoulder the skis only a few times from this point until reaching about mile 2.2, and this is where the real fun begins!
            From here it's a beautiful skin along the South Ridge of Bair Canyon to the South shoulder of Francis Peak.  Pay attention to how the snow
            reacts as you break trail.  You may also find a few good spots to dig a snow-pit.

            Topping out onto the road at about mile 3.75, you've got some options.  If the snow required ski crampons to this point, then it's possible the sun has
            softened the snow in the bowls East of the Peak.  Put some laps in on these until the North-Easterly slopes are ready.  Whatever the case,
            the featured run for Francis Peak drops off its South shoulder into Bair Canyon.  There may be a few rock bands to negotiate, but it's
            nothing too terribly difficult.  Once though the "choke", if you will, it opens up into an amazing slope with turns that seem to go forever!
            Since there's a slight northerly component to its aspect, the snow is often is in good condition, if I recall correctly.
        </p>

            A word to the wise: No matter which aspect you're skiing, don't drop directly off the top of Francis Peak!  The peak is marred with
            a great deal of radar and other types of equipment, and is abuzz with high-frequency radio-wave radiation.  Admittedly, I decided to ski
            directly off the peak one year and for that, returned home with a perminant momento: <i>tinnitus</i>.  I've learned to live with it, but trust me,
            no ski line is worth perminant hearing damage.

            Taken to a logical conclusion, this run (shown as a cyan line in the KML file), drops about 1700 vertical feet.  From there you can regain
            Wolverine Ridge or perhaps ascend toward the North and ski the main slopes at the head of Bair Canyon.  If you decide to exit by going through
            Bair Canyon, watch out for terrain traps as you try to locate the Bair Canyon Trail.  Of course, it helps to already be familiar with this trail,
            so I recommend scounting it out the summer before venturing here to ski.

            Yet another option is to go out along the North Ridge of Bear Canyon toward Eddie's Peak, then descent to Eddie's Flat.  That's certainly
            a possibility, but you'll have quite the hike along the BST to get back to the truck.

            Returning via Wolverine Ridge is what I've done the most.  Skiing the ridge as far as possible can actualy be a fun part of the tour.
            When it gets to bush-whack-skiing, just be patient and keep the skis on for buoyancy.  You'll know when it's time to start booting down.
            I recommend bringing a nice light-weight pair of running shoes and extra socks for the boot up and the boot down.  It feels so nice at the end of the day
            to remove the ski-boots and dawn the running shoes with dry socks, especially when you've got a long way yet to go to get to the truck.
