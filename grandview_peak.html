            A tour of Grandview Peak is a big day!  I feel very fortunate for having been able to get up
            there on skis, because City Creek Canyon has been undergowing major construction for the last
            several years (as of the time of this writing), and there are still a few years left to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've heard of people starting somewhere near Emigration Canyon, maybe hiking up over Lookout Peak,
            in order to get to Grandview.  Another approach is to simply follow Bountiful Ridge to the Burro Mine,
            then just keep going East.  The route detailed in this page simply goes straight up City Creek Canyon.
            There may yet still be other ways of getting there (sans helicopter or snowmobile, of course),
            but no matter how it's approached, the way in is quite long and difficult.  Indeed, Grandview, it seems, is just
            smack-dab in the middle of nowhere from all directions.

                This is a zoomed-out view of the entire tour.  The yellow portion is biked.
                The red portion is skinned or skied.

            Sadly, not too many pictures I took of this place survived over the years, but I'll post here what little I have.
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach is in two major legs: 1) biking to Rotory Park, and 2) skinning up the Meadows trail to the mouth
            of Cottonwood Gulch, then heading up the Gulch to the peak.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biking portion is straight forward.  You just go until you hit snow, then chain up your bike and skin the rest of the
            way.  Depending on what time of the year you go, you may be able to bike all the way to Rotory Park.  The bike, of course,
            is your saving grace at the end of the day.  It's your easy coast down the canyon!  Make sure your bike is well hidden,
            and that it's in good working order.

                This is the one slope I skied in the Grandview Area.  I think there might be a run that the WPBG take
                there clients on near here called Grand Slam or something like that.

            The trickiest part of the skin is making sure you don't miss the turn into Cottonwood Gultch.  My best advice is to hike
            the trail in summer and then scout out landmarks you can use when you return for the tour.  I ended up turning a bit too
            late, then ascending a drainage that put me on the South Ridge of Grandview.  I follows that ridge for a bit, but then skied
            off it into the gulch.  It's best to just skin directly into the gulch if you can.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the gulch, there may be some whacking, but it opens up nicely into an easy skin to the saddle just West of the peak.
            Follow the Saddle East to the peak, then enjoy a grand view!

                This is a view from the saddle at the top of the gulch.  From Grandview Peak, you can see so much, and you
                just want to ski everything in sight, but it's all so remote and difficult to reach.  Ahhhh, some day.

            I thoroughly enjoyed this tour.  Visiting the peak on skis is awesome, and City Creek Canyon is amazing.  Watch out for
            mountain lions and moose!
        </p>
        <p>
            After summetting, there are lots of ski options to choose from.  The one I chose is marked in the KML file.  Despite the low
            angle, however, don't miscount the exit run down the gulch as a favored run.  I thought it was just awesome!  So many turns in
            such a beautiful place!  There's also a strange natural half-pipe running down the center of it near the mouth.
        </p>

            Unfortunately, Grandview, like many places in the Wastach, is frequently overrun by snowmobiles or snowmotos.  While I was
            there, I saw old snowmoto tracks everywhere, but they weren't too agregious, and I was super lucky to not run into any motorized
            traffic.  Snowmoto tracks make these deep trenches in the snow, and they can really ruin a slope's ski quality.
            That and snowmotos smell hike hell and ruin the peace and solitude of your wilderness experience.  (If you can't tell,
            I really hate those damn things.)
        </p>

            I hope to go back once construction finishes.  That is, if I haven't become so overweight that I can't move anymore.
