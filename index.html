        <h1>Spencer's Ski Tour Guide</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome!  This is where I'm going to spill the beans on some of my favorite tours here in the Wasatch.
            If you want world-class skiing, go to the Cottonwoods like everyone else.  If you enjoy a bit more solitude and
            adventure, however, then consider the mountains along the Wasatch front from about as far north as Thurstan Peak to as far south
            as Grandview Peak.  I haven't skied everything in this range, but I have explored enough of it to have something to
            say about it.  It is a bit foolish to share this knowledge (rather than keep it secret), but the mountains
            are right there for everyone to plainly see as they drive down the freeway.  That, and I can't help
            contain my enthusiasm for the subject.

            What follows is a list of tours that I enjoy in the said area, each presented as a written description
            with pictures and downloadable KML files.  You can use <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/">Google Earth</a>
            to load the KML files, or the desktop version.  Either one.
