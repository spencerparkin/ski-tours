            Sigh...Kenny Peak!  Not a favorable aspect, and often wind hammered, but I'm not fooled in the least bit.
            There is good skiing to be had here, my friend!  In fact, ironically, the best powder day I've ever had
            in the Wasatch was here on Kenny Peak.  A few days before, I actually tried to skin up during the storm.
            Breaking trail was really, really hard.  I got about as far as the top of the gas pipeline, then had to
            turn back.  The ski down was amazing!  I was spitting out snow, bouncing left and right, both arms swinging
            through knee-deep powder, or deeper.  But this isn't the great power day I'm trying to talk about.  No!

                These are the reminants of the old cabin along the Kenny Creek trail.  Someone burned it down
                a long time ago.  Since then, other cabins have popped up in the area.

            You see, the skin during the storm was actually really important.  Had I not done this, my attempt to go
            up to Kenny Peak two days later would have been too difficult.  But, having broken trail to the top of
            the gas pipeline two days earlier, it saved me a ton of energy when I returned.  Once at the top of the
            gas pipeline, and had to start breaking trail again, but it wasn't too far to go.  I really think that
            breaking trail the whole way would have been too hard for me on this particular occasion.

            Amazingly, once at the peak, there was no wind and the sun hadn't damanged anything.  It was cold smoke powder!
            I couldn't believe it.  When they talk about lake-effect snow, this was it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow, getting up there is pretty straightforward.  As was already mentioned, you just take the gas pipeline
            as shown in the KML file.  I like to leave it to gain a sub-ridge before the gas pipeline meets up with the
            main ridge.  This avoid a sharp dip, and it's faster anyway.  As the sub-ridge merges with the main ridge,
            things open up into what feels like a vast sea of snow!  It feels so big, that as you're skinning, you don't
            feel like you're going anywhere.  (It's kind of like road-biking the cause-way to Antelope Island with miles
            of road ahead and miles behind you.)

            Once at the peak, there are some great shots down the South-West face.  Yes, it's not the most favorable aspect,
            but other aspects are either too short or don't have an easy skin back up to the top for another lap.  After lapping
            the peak as many times as you like, what I like to do is make one last run off the peak, but instead of stopping
            at your usual skin-up point, ski beyond it all the way down to where the Kenny Creek trail crosses a stream.
            You can usually cross on a snow-bridge here and skin your way back to Kenny Creek Cabin.

                My ski tracks down the South-West face of Kenny Peak on the best powder day ever!  Yes, it looks a bit thin,
                but the coverage was still really good, and the snow was amazing.

            From the cabin it's an easy-breezy skin back to the top of the gas pipeline.  On a good snow-year, you'll be able
            to ski this all the way down to the bottom of Mueller Park canyon, then ski down the canyon bottom back
            to the truck.  Of course, you'll get weird looks from everyone, but they have no idea what's up there.  The most ridiculous reaction
            I get are the people who comment on how fun it must be to come to Mueller Park and ski the road.  Yup, that's
            why I came here lady; to ski the road.

            Now, I've raved in this page about the snow quality I encountered here on Kenny Peak, and it was no lie.  However,
            it's tricky to find good conditions here.  I once made the mistake of coming here a day or two after it rained on the
            snow pack.  Big mistake!  The rain just destroys the snow quality, but it's even worse than that.  You see, under bad
            snow conditions, you can usually survival-ski back to your truck.  Point the skis across the slope, glide across,
            perform a down-hill kick-turn, repeat.  But not under the conditions I found on this particular day!
        </p>
        <p>
            The snow was so awful that survival skiing was near impossible!  My skis would sink below the rain crust into channels
            that locked the direction of the skis.  While gliding across the slope, the channels were so ridged that I couldn't
            turn in any direction whatsoever.  Not even a little bit!  Maybe a very athletic skier could jump out of the channels
            to re-point the skis in mid-air.  I don't know.  All I know is that I had a terrible, terrible time that day getting
            off the mountain.  You couldn't take the skis off, because you'd sink too far into the snow, making walking impossible
            or too impractical.  Putting the skis back on, the torture continued.

            Admittedly, once I finally got to the bottom of the canyon, I think I had exhausted my entire cursing vocabulary.
            I had had enough.  I was just done.  What's really interesting to me, though, is that when I think of Kenny Peak, this bad experience
            isn't the first thing I remember.  What I remember is the great ski days I've had up there.  Again, you can't judge a place
            by any bad skiing experience you may have there.  The art of backcountry skiing is all about being in a place
            at the right time.  There really is no right or wrong place.
