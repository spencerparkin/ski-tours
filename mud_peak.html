        <p>
            I love skiing Mud Peak in Farmington Canyon!  And I love it so much that I'm willing to work for it.
            The best way up there is, of course, by helicopter.  Next is snomobile.  And after that it's E-bike or motorcycle.
            But if you're like me and you have neither, don't despair.  There are sill some reasonably practical options.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the canyon road now, for many years, is no longer plowed.  One year the road washed out and needed
            major repair.  While that was happening, the Francis Peak employees were choppered to work as an alternative.  Turns out, once the
            road was fixed, they found that the chopper was more economical than plowing the road, so the backcountry community
            lost out on that particular access advantage.  Still, the road is so scary, that I wouldn't have driven it anyway.

            Two options are the Farmington Spine Trail and the Farmington Canyon Trail, and
            I wouldn't say that one is necessarily better than the other.  As far as difficulty is concerned,
            the spine is much more strenuous than the canyon trail, but the spine is, in my opinion,
            much more scenic.  I'll address both.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, the canyon trail.  (See the green line in the KML file.)  This route is essentially to take the canyon road, but with the Farmington
            Canyon Trail used as a major short-cut.  It takes miles off the approach and exit!
            The trail reconnects with the canyon road at the old (perminantly closed) Sunset Campground.
            From there it's a super easy, albeit an exhaust-fume weary skinner to the Sherriff's Cabin.
        </p>
        <p>
            This, unfortunately, is where things get a bit tricky.  You see, to access the terrain above the cabin,
            you have to cross private property.  It is a terrible shame that there isn't a right-of-way here for
            backcountry access.  However, once the stream near the cabin is crossed (and I'm not by any means condoning the practice),
            you're officially on the tour and clear of private property.
        </p>
        <p>
            Word to the wise: beware of the stream in Spring time.  The current can be very powerful and overflowing.
            Fording the stream might be too difficult.  There is a fjord upstream of the cabin that you might consider
            as an alternative crossing point, but again, it is on private land.
        </p>

        <p>
            Above the cabin it is a wonderfully beautiful skin up Mud Peak along the Mud/Rice Divide.  Careful route-finding
            is warrented here to avoid terrain traps.  Look for the beaver dams!
        </p>
        <p>
            On the way back, just reverse the entire approach.  From Mud Peak, instead of taking the Mud/Rice Divide, you might
            consider the West side of Rice creek to get back to the cabin.  But note that this requires another river crossing,
            sometimes aided by the beaver dams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Historically, I used to push my bike up the Farmington Canyon Trail
            so that I could just coast down the canyon road (skipping the short-cut) at the end of the day.  This worked, and it might have even
            been a bit more efficient, but I hated doing it.  First, the canyon road might not be entirely bike-worthy, and there are shear drop-offs along the road.
            Second, where it is dirt, it's quite uneven, and you're top-heavy with skis mounted on your pack as you pedal your bike, unless you can somehow reasonably mount your skis to
            the frame of your bike.  (I tried that once and burned the top-sheet of my ski as it rubbed against the back tire!)
        </p>
        <p>
            I've come to find that just reversing the entire approach is the best way (for me) to exit, and helps me avoid the road as much
            as possible.  I find the motorized traffic terribly annoyting due to the noxious smell of exhaust fumes.  I must also add that the stretch
            of canyon road from the cabin to Sunset Campground is mostly an easy-breezy downhill ski, just with a bit of skating at the end.
            If you're a strong skier, then you can probably skate to the campground.  I usually skate a bit, then boot the rest of the way there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, let me say that hitch-hiking is just a bad, bad idea; trust me; I tried it once.  First, you have to ride in the back of their
            stupid truck with their "sled" as the call it, and they're going to yell at you to make sure your skis don't scratch the body of their precious machine.
            Second, they probably can't drive up the canyon as far as you'd hope they can.  Third, you're setting yourself up to easily collide
            with them on the trail once they get their infernal snowmobiles running and spewing poisenous exhaust fumes.  And last but not least,
            one of your skis might fall out of the truck as you're bouncing around back there.  Know how I know?  Yeah, it happened to me!  After banging
            on the window for the guy to stop, he let me out, then I had to hike back <i>down canyon(!)</i> at least a quarter mile to try to find my ski before some other
            truck came along to run it over.  Thankfully, I got it back, then, still determined not to quit, hiked a ridicuously steep shortcut to gain
            a portion of the canyon road further on, then skinned a ridiculous number of miles to the cabin, along which I breathed in at least five
            snomobiles worth of exhaust fumes.  Sigh....  And then the snow happened to be crap above the cabin, so I turned back before reaching the
            peak anyway.  It was all for nothing.
        </p>

                but oh so good in the bowls to the North East!  Near the end of the day, the sun had softened the snow on the spine, making the
                exit runs enjoyable too.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The spine (red line in the KML file), on the other hand, has, thankfully, no legal problems, and (cue the angelic music) no fume problems either; but yes, it is much harder.
            It is a brutal booter until about mile 1.85, at which point, you can usually skin-up.  From here it's a bush-whack skin
            until you reach the clearning at about mile 2.35.  This is where the tour officially begins and you can really start to
            enjoy yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
            There isn't much else to say about the approach from there, so let's talk about the exit.  Of course, you're not committed
            to exiting back the way you came.  You could go down Farmington Canyon Trail if you need to, but if you do return along the
            spine, then, in my view, you're in for a real treat!  There is some fun skiing to be had along the spine, at least in terms
            of scenery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that there is a relatively flat section that is skiable only if you get as much speed as possible before
            you get there.  I get such a smile on my face going through this flat section, trees whizzing past me on my left and right,
            just standing on my skis enjoy an incredible blue-bird day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the flat section is a nice off-falline ski slope before you descend into the whack.  It is a bit surreal going down it
            in the spring.  There you are, the city in view, everyone down there doing their summer activities with you making a
            beautiful spring ski descent!  I can't help but smile ear to ear doing that run, especially if I had a good day in the Rice
            or Mud bowls earlier.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Here the cyan line shows one of my favorite runs off Mud Peak and down Rice Bowl.  It ends in a beautiful stand
                of aspects which not only make a great way to skin back up to regain the divide, but are a fun ski run in and of themselves.
                I skied them once, for example, on a day when I felt the bowls below Mud Peak were too unstable.

        <p>
            Into the trees, it's a bush-whack-ski back to your original skin-up point.  It's tempting to take the skis off at times, but you
            need to keep them on for bouyancy.  Just be patient and you'll eventually get there.  Consider keeping the sunglasses on to protect
            your eyes from getting poked out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, boot your way back down the rest of the spine trail.  This is a knee buster, especially with skis and ski boots
            mounted to your back.  As I've mentioned on other tours, I recommend bringing along a good pair of running shoes and extra
            socks that you can change into for this part of the approach and exit.  I usually keep my running shoes inside a plastic bag
            to separate them from everything else in my pack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I'll say here that, provided we had a good enough winter, you can usually get one final hurrah out of Mud Peak in the spring once the
            gate finally opens near the mouth of the canyon, allowing vehicles to get as far as the junction just below the road to Francis Peak.
            By this time, the snow has burned off the road sufficiently, and the drive up there isn't too terrible.  (Although, admittedly, every
            time I drive it I tell myself to never do it again.)  From the junction you can hike up through the roads towards Bountiful Peak
            and then leave them when it seems right to make your way to Mud Peak.  Just fallow your nose and make your stream crossing carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alas, late enough in the spring, the snow up there just isn't worth it anymore, even if there's a good enough base.  The snow just isn't
            supportive enough for your skins and it's slopping all over.  That's when it's time, I'm afraid, to call it quits.  Until next season!
