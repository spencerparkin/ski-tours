            Back in the day I did a lot of trail running.  One of my favorite places to run was Hidden Lake Circle.  The run from
            there up to Dude Peak was a favorite of mine.  Even before you made the peak, there were several great views of Sessions Peak
            to be had along the way.  Looking at the peak with snow on it, an obvious line just pops right out at you, and you know it must be skied!

                This shows just a few lines I've skied into Rocky Basin.  My favorite is the one of the right which
                skis right from the top of Sessions Peak.  I typically exit out the yellow line, whack the purple,
                then ski back down the reamining cyan line to a point below the Kenny Creek Cabin.

            That's one of the great things about backcountry skiing.  It's all about seeing a line on the mountain and then making it happen!
            You plan your approach, plan your bail options, plan your exits, etc.
            This was certainly the case for me with Sessions Peak, and at the time of this writing, I've gone back every year since to ski it at least once.
            Due to its aspect, it's not always in the best condition (I've rarely found it great condition), but I still enjoy it, because I just
            think it's a really cool line in a beautiful place.  Having done the line so many times, I can tell you about the different ways I've approached the mountain, what worked, and what didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
            My initial touring stratagy was to approach as per <a href="kenny_peak.html">Kenny Peak</a> (the red line in the KML file), then hike the ridge (orange line.)  This works, but
            the ridge portion leading to the peak is quite difficult and time-consuming.  You won't be able to skin the whole way.  I brought ice-axe and
            boot-crampons, and they were certainly nice to have.  There was in one spot along the more technical part of the ridge a tricky downclimb that
            had to be negotiated.  Whatever the case, I always tried to make the ridge as easy as possible by going around something rather than trying
            to climb over it.  Note the cornices go nuts on this ridge, and falls can be quite consequntial!  Indeed, the ridge here is a little taste
            of mountaineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Risk = Probability x Consequence -->
            I took this ridge-route several times until I found an easier way.  And it's not as if this wasn't obvious before (it was), but I shied away
            from it because it was a bit riskier avalance-wise.  The alternative to the ridge is to simply ski into Rocky Basin from Kenny Peak,
            then reascend to Sessions Peak up the same way you intend to ski down it.  Admittedly, this is how I do it now every time I go, because
            even though you lose a lot of elevation that must be regained, it's so much easier (and I would argue, enjoyable) than hiking the ridge.
            Of course, it means betting on the stability of a few more aspects than just what you intended to ski, so you need to be reasonably confident
            things aren't going to slide on you.

                I didn't think to take a picture until I was nearly out of the basin this day.

        <p>
            Yet another way I've tried to do it is to simply take the Kenny Creek Trail all the way into Rocky Basin.  Once in the basin, simply hike
            straight up the center of it (yellow line in the KML file) to the base of the runs.  This wasn't very practical, though.  It's too much hiking and
            some of it a bit of a whack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of bush-whacking, once you're finally in Rocky Basin, there is no easy way of out of it.  The entire place is walled in by
            avalanche terrain.  I typically exit by skiing down the center (yellow line) to the Kenny Creek Trail, which is pretty hard to find
            under the snow.  In any case, even if you follow this trail, you still have to ascend slopes that are at or near the prime-slide angle.
            But once you're out, there's a bit of skiing you can do to get below the cabin.  Exit, then, as per the Kenny Creek tour.

            They call it Rocky Basin for a reason.  There are lots of rocks in there, and they do heat up!  On one particular day, I ignored three red flags!
            First, the day started out very cold, as usual, but then it got surprisingly hot.  Second, it didn't just get hot, it got hot <i>really fast</i>!  And third,
            the snowpack had not yet been tested with such heat!  Sigh...But, despite these warnings, I skied off of Kenny Peak into Rocky Basin anyway.
            Sure enough, I triggered a wet-slide.  One of the scary things about it is that I had no idea it was chasing me down the mountain.  For whatever
            reason, I decided to traverse a bit mid-pitch or so into a different fall-line.  After skiing that fall-line a bit, I decided to traverse back
            into the original fall-line.  Before I could do so I was surprised to see a wet-slide come rushing down the mountain in the original line!
            Needless to say, I stopped then and there and watched it hurtle down the mountain in a dumb stuper.

            The avalance didn't seem that big, but it would definately have taken me for a very long ride.  The debre field didn't look too terribly big, but it
            could have at least partially burried me.  But it didn't even have to do any of that!  All it had to do was injur me or cause me to lose
            my equipment.  Being that far from your car with no way out is a big problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow, it was a wake-up call.  Each Spring now, I'm constantly thinking about the potential for wet-slides.  Your timing in the Spring has
            got to be good.  Get there early and don't overstay your welcome.  Change your aspect throughout the day to avoid snow that's getting too wet.
            Spring skiing is a bit of an art-form.  You want to time things just right so that the snow is softened by the sun, but not destabilized.

            There are so many more great lines in Rocky Basin I have yet to get after.  But I'm at peace if the only lines I ever get done are the
            ones I've already done, because they're the most interesting and aesthetically please to me when I stare at it.
            There are some lines off the North side of Sessions Peak that the Powder Bird Guides take their clients on.  (I've chucked their LZ landing flags off the peak a few times in protest.)
            I've not done these lines, because there doesn't seem to be an easy or safe way to skin back up to the peak to get out.  I've thought about skiing off to the South-East, but again,
            the deeper you go into the backcountry, the harder it is to get back out.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I were going to ski off the North side of Sessions Peak, I would ski over to the beautiful aspent forest that's just below the Great Western Trail.
            Then hike through that forest to link up with the GWT, then follow that East to link up with Sessions Mountain Ridge, and then follow that to Sessions Peak.
            It's totally doable and I know the area really well having hiked it several times in the summer.  It's just a matter of being fit-enough, having the right conditions,
            and being motivated enough as well.
