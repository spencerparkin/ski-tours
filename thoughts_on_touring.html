        <h1>My Thoughts On touring</h1>
        <p>
            Obviously touring is something I enjoy, but there's a lot that goes into it.  Here I wanted to share some of my
            thoughts on this particular type of activity.
        </p>
        <h2>Solo Touring</h2>
        <p>
            There's lots to cover, but before we get into anything practical, we have to first address the elephant in the room: solo touring.
            In short, just don't do it.  Ever.  Never do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said, why do I tour almost exclusively alone?  It's simple.  If I was adament that I never, ever go to the mountains without
            a touring partner, then I would never have an opportunity to go!  And that's just unacceptable to me!
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes a touring partner slows you down, and in my case, more often than not, I must admit, I'm the one slowing
            the other guy down.  Once the tour is over, you both part ways cordially, and then you never hear from them again,
            because they never want to tour with you ever again, and how can you blame them?
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also ridiculously hard to align schedules.  And there's nothing worse than starting out on a tour only
            to hear your partner say, "yeah, so, I need to be back by noon, is that okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
            And then there's the conflict of goals.  You don't mind exploring a new area at the risk of it being a dud,
            while your partner wants to go visit a familiar area yet again that's proven to have good snow, but one of which
            you've grown a bit tired.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are all sorts of reasons it's hard to tour with a partner, let a lone an entire group of two or more people.
            Sometimes the leader puts in a completely BS skin track that's so steep you have to break trail anyway.
            I've also read in books that there's a benefit to the "wisdom of the croud" when making decisions.  In my experience,
            decisions made by committee can be really stupid due to social pressures and other social factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, solo touring is born, and it's extremely addictive.  It's freedom of the hills personafied!  But yes, if you
            get caught in an avalanche, you're gunna die, because there's no one around who can dig you out.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to point out in all this, however, just to be clear, that you should never, ever make avalanche rescue a contingency plan.
            (I.e., let's ski this slope and hey, if it slides, I'll dig you out, okay?)
            Whether you solo tour or not, if an avalanche
            rescue is needed, then you failed to manage the risk (or were just extraordinarily unlucky.)
            Avalanche rescue doesn't work very well, and it's just there as an added margin of safety.  But it's a margin of safety that, admittedly,
            is unwise to do without.  As a solo tourer, you've chosen to take the risk that you won't need an avalanche rescue, and if
            you're wrong, you won't only be dead, but you're going to look really stupid too.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point it's worth asking: what exactly is risk?  I would define it as the product of the probability that something will go wrong with the magnitude of
            the consequences should it actually happen.  So since risk is directly proportional to both of these variables, we have
            to see how we can decrease either or both of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Avalanche rescue helps mitigate consequences, but again, it's not a guarentee.  Both you and your partner must be
            well trained in avalanche rescue techniques.  Admittedly, the last time I did a beacon search was many years ago
            when I took an avalanche class up one of the Cottonwoods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything else you do to manage risk is, I believe, about reducing the probability that something will go wrong.
            The great equalizer in this case is terrain.  If you can properly identify avalanche terrain and non-avalanche terrain,
            then you can win every time by simply staying out of avalanche terrain.  And I think this can actually make solo
            touring perfectly legitimate if done correctly.  It's a great way to get out there and practice your skills without being
            dependant on a partner, or worried your touring partner will lose patience with you as you struggle to make a kick turn
            or get your skins off your skis.
        </p>
        <p>
            But let's face it.  Relatively speaking, non-avalanche terrain is boring.  The funnest stuff to ski is the stuff that can slide!
            One way to manage this is to first be keenly aware of what kind of "avalanche dragon" is afoot (as I read in a book somewhere.)
            Are we dealing primarily with wet slides?  Dry loose sluffs?  Or is it the dreaded slab avalanche (the white death)?
        </p>
        <p>
            I suppose now I'm digressing into details that are better left treated in an avalanche book.  Suffice it to say, you need
            to read one of these books cover to cover multiple times a year, and take an avalanche class at least once.  Now, in that avalanche class,
            they will never condone solo touring, and I'm not advocating for it here either.  But I do solo tour anyway for reasons that I hope
            are clear by now, and reasons I hope aren't entirely stupid.
            I know a lot of other people who do it too (not to say that's any justification for it, of course.)
            That's just to say that it's a common practice, and I can certaily understand why people do it.
        </p>
        <h2>Packing</h2>
        <p>
            Once you leave the truck, what you brought with you is all you're going to have to support yourself in the field.
            Thus, choosing what to bring, and what to leave, is an important skill all its own.
        </p>
        <p>
            It mainly comes down to experience.  After each tour, ask yourself, "did I really need this?" or "what did I wish I had that I didn't bring?"
            Of course, just because you didn't use something you brought on the tour doesn't mean you should never pack it.  On the other hand,
            you have to keep in mind that the weight of your pack really does matter.  You're going to be taking thousands of steps, and if you can
            shave off even a little weight, it makes a big difference over so many steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of weight, something that's not often talked about with packing, but which I think is really important, is the weight
            distrobution of your pack.  You want to organize your pack as much as possible so that while wearing it, your center of mass is
            changed as little as possible.  A poorly balanced pack will give your back problems over long distances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other vital component of your pack--and I'm a huge believer in this--is the hip belt.  No hip belt?  Get a pack with a hip belt!
            And I don't mean some flimsy coord around your waist.  You want a big beafy hip belt, which, by the way, doesn't necessarily mean you
            need a big beafy pack.  However big your pack is, you want most of its weight being born by your hips, not your shoulders.  This makes
            a huge difference over miles and miles of hiking!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, what to bring?  Here I must admit to some unwise practices.  For example, I never bring a first aide kit.  Should you bring one?
            I'm sure you should, but I never do.  I'm probably asking for trouble.  But I do always bring a small pouch with ski crampons, leashes,
            helistraps, and screwdriver (for binding adjustments.)  All of these come in handy when you're out there, especially the helistraps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next comes layers!  Don't be fooled into buying the one piece of winter clothing that claims to do everything.  You don't want that.
            You want flexibility in your layer system.  Staying warm is all about staying dry, and that means adjusting what layers you're wearing
            as necessary along the tour.  Generally, you layer down when moving because you're generating heat, and then layer up when you stop
            for any significant amount of time so that you can trap that heat immediately.  With practice, you can mitigate sweating too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bring a base layer (next to skin, which never comes off, unless I'm doing a first nude descent of something, of course), one or two mid-layers,
            a puffy coat, and a hard or softshell layer.  What combination of these you wear at any point takes some practice.  Make sure each of these
            layers is designed for mountain travel.  Cotton is never a good fabric to use.  Also, bring multiple pairs of gloves!  If your gloves get wet
            and you don't have any spares, it's not a good situation.  I like to bring a few pairs of linear gloves and a good pair of mittens with
            wrist leashes.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, of course, don't forget food and water!  Admittedly, I can be really bad about both of these.  I'll sometimes bring no food, or
            become dehydrated, because I didn't bring enough water.  Water adds a significant amount of weight to your pack, so you have to really
            guess well how much you'll really need.  Note that you can pre-hydrate before you leave your car, and also plan to hydrate once you
            return to it, so that can help you esimate how much water to bring.  Again, this is just something that comes down to tuning based on
            your own experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always keep a headlamp with extra betteries in a dedicated pocket on my pack!  This is important, because if it's really dark, often the
            first thing you need to find is your headlamp, and you don't want to be digging through your pack trying to find it.  You want to be able
            to easily find it when you can see anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next is suncap, sunglasses and sunscreen!  I can't tell you how many times I've come back burnt like a lobster.  Admittedly, it's taken me
            a while to learn how important these are.  Sunglasses, by the way, can also help protect your eyes while bush-whacking.  Also, when you
            apply sunscreen, don't put in on your fourhead.  Your suncap will protect your fourhead.  You don't want sunscreen dripping down into your eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh yeah, and then there's the whole beacon, shovel and probe.  I know this is blaspheme, but there are tours where I just leave these at home.
            (Gasp!!)  I know, I know.  This is total herracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is another call I make alongside solo touring.  You should, of course, always bring these three items, if for no other reason, to make
            it a habit.  That said, if I'm going super-light, I will sometimes leave them to save a bit of weight.  (Then again, if the weight of a probe
            is going to break the weight-bank, then I probably have bigger problems in terms of physical fitness.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking a beacon with you while solo touring can make the difference between your family having to wait a day or two, or until Spring, to
            get your body back.  So consider taking it.  And who knows, there might be some random stranger in the same area who witnesses the avalanche
            and then comes heroically to your rescue.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shovel and the probe are great for digging pits and doing some analysis of the snowpack.  If I know I won't be digging a pit, I'll leave them.
            But if there's a chance I might, I always bring them along with a snow-saw.  I have one that can attach to my ski-pole, which is nice.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where my wife would say to bring tissues.  We can never agree on things like this.  I say snot-rockets are the best way to go!
        </p>
        <p>
            Last but not least, don't forget your skins!  It's the worst when you get to the trailhead and then realize you forgot your skins.
            Skinwax is also great to have, along with quick-was (for your ski bases in a pinch.)  Keeping your skis waxed really well is key,
            not just glide, but also making sure your skin glue stays on the skin rather than your ski bases.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know that some people use airbags.  I've never owned one, but I think it would be nice to have one as long as it didn't take up too much room in the pack.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also recommend a pack that can do an A-frame carry of your skis.  If your pack can't do this (or some other type of ski carry), then
            you don't want it unless, I supposed, you only plane to do tours where you can always skin up at the car.  But I think that's lame.  There
            are so many great tours to be done where you have to boot it for a while first before putting on ski boots.  Note that one advantage
            of the A-frame style carry is that you can have your ski boots mounted to the skis while your skis are mounted to your pack.  I do this all the time,
            and I get funny looks from fellow hikers for it too.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's about as much as I can think of for now.  Sometimes a nice thermous is fun to have so you can sip some hot cocoe in the high alpine!
        </p>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <p>
            Ever heard the saying, "there are no bad skis, just bad skiers"?  Well, I think that's mostly true, but not entirely.  Having the right
            equipement, I believe, is absolutely essential to success in the backcountry.  Let me detail here the evolution of my equipment journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            My initial setup was a decision made for me by the salesperson, because I had no idea what I was doing.  I just said I was interested in
            touring.  What I got were skis that were terribly heavy with frame bindings.  The guy at the store, though, was pretty smart.  He knew
            that I knew nothing, was a total noob, and so he got me something that limitted my range, and that would be very safe in terms of the binding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Frame bindings are very safe, because they work just like an in-bounds resort bindings, except that they have a touring mode where the whole
            binding can lift off the ski, hinging at the toe.  A problem with this, though, of course, is that it's not very efficient weight-wise.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my next setup, I thought that I had become quite wise, and decided to go for the "one ski quiver!" (which doesn't exist, by the way.)
            The setup was lighter and used the (at the time) brandnew Shift Binding<sub>TM</sub>!  This, like the frame binding, was very safe, but
            it toured akin to a traditional pin-binding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alas, this too was just too heavy and too impractical.  Plus, you constantly need to clear away snow from the binding with each transition
            you make, or it will clog up unti it becomes non-functional.
        </p>
        <p>
            After touring with that setup for a while, I finally wised up and decided to go ultra light-weight!  Enter my Helio 88 skis (88 under foot)
            with a true light-weight pin binding!  Now these skis were awesome!  And I use them to this day on many, many tours, espeically the big
            one-and-doner days.  These, along with my carbin-fiber boots, let me just fly up the mountain!  The problem, though, is that without a bit
            more mass in the ski, you're more prone to deflection, especially in variable or less desirable snow conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few years of that, I finally found the perfect touring setup to feed my addiction: my Elan Ripstick Tours, 104 underfoot, with
            pin binding, and Dynafit Radical Pro ski boots!  This was a heavier setup, but not too heavy!  It the waist width of the ski gives a
            better overall mountain performance, especially in powder.  Thes are the funnest skis I've ever owned!  They're a great balance between
            being lightweight, but also performant.  You need some mass in the skis for stability, but you also don't want them so heavy that
            they're harder to turn, or too hard to cary up the mountain on your back, or even just skinning.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for ski brakes, you don't want them.  They're just extra weight you don't need, and if your ski gets away from you, then you screwed
            up already.  Use leashes if you need to.  (I learned that leason the hard way, actually, but I won't digress.)  It's best to transition
            from skinning to downhill skiing while staying locked into the binding if at all possible.  With a bit of practice, it's not too hard
            to rip your skins off while locked into your bindings.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, the Ripsticks, unlike all the previous skis, did not replace my previous setup.  I don't think there's just one setup that
            works best for every touring scenario.  I basically now just have two touring setups: the Helios and the Ripsticks, and which I take
            depends on the tour.  If it's a mountaineering feat, I'll likely take the Helios.  If it's a powder day, the Ripsticks for sure.
            Like many other things, what ski setup you take just comes down to experience and a bit of guess work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now what about ski boots?  These are critical, because these are the man-machine interface.  I've had quite the struggle with getting
            ski boots to fit properly.  One thing's for sure: if you get a new pair of ski boots, don't go for a massive tour the following day!
            Go on a small tour so that you can identify fitting problems and not having to walk several miles back to your car in extreme pain.
            (I've made this mistake!)
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to think that heat-molding the liner was stupid, because it would reduce the liner's lifetime.  Well, sure, it might do that,
            but it can also work miracles for your foot!  Note that not all liners can be heatmolded, and even less store employees know that either.
            Do your research.
        </p>
        <p>
            After heat-molding, if your bones are still banging up against the shell of the boot, don't hesitate to get the shell punched.
            This is where a ski shop guy will help you identify the trouble-spots, then take a heat gun to the shell to warp it just enough to
            give your foot more room.  Believe me (and my bunions), it's worth it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Ski boots don't have to be the bane of skiing.  They can actually be awesome.  I love my Backland Carbonfiber ski boots.  They articulate
            so well that I can drive a car with them on, and they're crampon compatible.  They have quite a soft flex, but I've never felt like
            that was a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also don't think that you need a beefy boot for a beefy ski.  You can drive a pretty big ski with a lightweight boot just fine.
            That's how I feel, anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, don't be afraid of pin bindings.  It does take more torque to get you out of them, but they do indeed work.  I know, because
            I've crashed many times in them, and come out of them.  Just don't ski them with the toe locked!
        </p>
        <p>
            Pin bindings really are the only way to go.  They're very leightweight and simple, which means less likely to have problems like
            the Shift bindings I had mentioned earlier.  You can also easily adjust them with a screw-driver, depending on the model.
        </p>
        <h2>Nutrition & Fitness</h2>
        <p>
            There is no substitute for fitness in the backcountry.  You can be prepared in all sorts of ways, but if you don't have the
            fitness, you won't go far, or worse, you won't make it back to the truck.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to do a ton of trail running.  It wasn't unheard of for me to do a 10K over very hilly terrain.  Now I can hardly move,
            but I get out and hike as often as I can to keep from being entirely sedintary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Admittedly, I don't have much wisdom to share when it comes to physical fitness; I just know that it's your ally in touring, and
            can mean the difference between having a successful outing or a fantastic one.  That difference is usually measured in powder laps.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just plopped a chocolate in my mouth as I'm typing this.  I can feel all my blubber zones instantly expanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Food is an interesting thing in the mountains.  What's interesting to me is that for some things I eat at home, I can't stand
            to eat them in the mountains.  It has something to do with your body needing very high quality food during a time when
            you're working much harder than usual, and have a long way to go.  Expirament with what kinds of foods you take with
            you into the mountains.  Find out what you can stomach, and what you can't; what makes you feel good, and what doesn't
            really help your energy levels.  Some food is just terrible when you're expending a lot of energy, usually the fake-sugar stuff.
            I find that apples and oranges work really well.  Peanut butter and honey sandwiches work well too, but not peanut butter
            and jelly, because the jelly has crappy sugar in it.
